# tic-tac-toe

## Instructions for Testing
To test the tic-tac-toe game, you will be playing against the computer twice. Here's what you should do in the test:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install pytest, the testing framework:

    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3. Run the tests using the following command:

    ```bash
    pytest tests.py
    ```
4. You are Player X, and you will then be asked several times to make a move. To cover all test cases, please observe the board and make sure you make **at least one invalid move in each game**. (Invalid move = placing your symbol in a non-empty spot.)
